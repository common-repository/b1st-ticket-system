    so easy to navigate and learn as you navigate through, without even the need to experiment with the help files.
</p>

<p><strong>Spam Detection & Prevention</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>The first prevention layer by enabling reCAPTCHA to stop bot messages.</li>
    <li>The second layer by integrating A.kis.met, the best automated spam killer that actually gets better as it
        learns.
    </li>
</ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Message Target</strong><br>
    From a frontend perspective, messages can be delivered to special divisions and special products with a specific
    priority.<br>
    On the other hand, from a backend perspective, messages can be filtered by divisions, products, and priorities;
    even more, they can be searched by email and ticket number.<br>
    <br>
    <strong> Virus Protection</strong><br>
    B1st Wordpress Ticket System makes use of OPSWAT Metascan API to scan any files attached to customers messages; thus
    ensuring it is clean and not infected by any virus or malware that may damage your server security.<br>
    <br>
    <em>Why Multi-Scanning?</em> No single anti-malware engine is perfect 100% of the time. Using multiple engines
    to scan for threats allows you to take advantage of the strengths of each individual engine.
    Multiple Products. B1st Wordpress Ticket System allows a customer to send his inquiry to the proper product department support team; thus, if you have multiple products, each message will be sent to the proper department.

    reply to thmem.</p>

    accounts, or Horrde accounts. Horde is available at all shared hosting providers that use cpanel or plesk as
    their control panel; in fact, almost all web hosting providers do. </p>

<p><em>Even more</em>, B1st Wordpress Ticket System will prioritize your received messages according to their original priority
    when they were sent to your email account.
    As a double-spam protection, these messages will be scanned by A.Kis.Met API in addition to the detection
    methods used by your email provider, e.g.,Gmail.
    And finally, if these messages have any attachments, they will be scanned for any virus or malware by OPSWAT
    Metascan API.</p>
